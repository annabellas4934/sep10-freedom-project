# Entry 3 : Brainstroming Future Technology

## Content:
After researching the technology we currently have, I organized the ideas by a generic section, whether they helped with notetaking, office comfort, payment processing, and communication. Then I thought of ideas for new innovations that would be beneficial for people in business. I had spent some time in class struggling to think of creative inventions that seemed interesting. But then I took some time to think and inspiration from upper classman's projects and came up with one software idea and one hardware. And an app and a new design for a chair.

## Links: 
When I was confused about how I should start concepting ideas on future inventions, I opened a source that was provided by Mr. Mueller, ["previous projects"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A9c3MeOK8fK8ylRY06DXC-QLbdJjKKj4lvDp-UHlbHU/edit?gid=0#gid=0)which helped inspire me. I randomly picked one of the many projects offered, and I had landed on [Xinyang's project](https://xinyangl5722.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) which made me realized that I could separate my ideas by focusing on either software or hardware. Thinking strictly about software helped me think of an app idea, same going for hardware where it helped be something physical.

## Skills:
Googling: A classmate, after seeing one of my ideas, had shown me a similar product that is used in the gaming industry, hence why I wasn't aware of it from just looking up "office chairs." I personally looked it up and found the design to be a bit inconvenient to use due to its size. So this made me think of ways my invention could be different from the gaming chairs like its size and how the screen would work without the large overhead.

Creativity: I thought about ideas for a while, thinking about something that can be invented, though they already were. My teachers then said there were examples I could take inspiration from and the invention didn't necessarily need to be achieved in this day and age, but sometime in the future. So it got me thinking. I went a simple route by thinking of an app that can do it all for you. Next I tried to make something that can help something I've been struggling with. My posture is not the greatest and it's hard for me to sit on a chair comfortably for hours so I slouch, and when I do my neck bends to see the screen and I just can't work. So I thought, what if the screen was always following my face, then it wouldn't be so hard to look at. 

## EDP
I'm still currently working on the brainstorming engineering design process, but soon will move onto the planning step. I still need to do research on what would be needed in this so-called app I want to design. I want the app to include how to make a business but I myself don't particularly know how to do so. I must research how to do that so I can implicate it on the app.
