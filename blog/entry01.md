## Why Did I Choose This Topic?
  As a student of the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/) in [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) I will create a year long project called a Freedom Project. For my project I chose the topic of business. My other options included finance and accounting. No matter what I would have picked, I'll still be studying about money. I specifically picked business due to it having the concepts of the other topics within itself. Now, the reason why I am so invested in the topic is because I'm highly interested in that field. I don't particularly find interest in physical work, having someone's life in my hands, and I'm not the best debater, so I wouldn't go into law, medical, or anything of the sort. With business I can go a multiple of directions. I am also influenced by my social media page and my parents. On social media I often see these small businesses that sell all sorts of products that they personally designed. My mother often likes to try many things that may help me pick a career such as asking me to sell my own t-shirts on amazon. Due to these reasons, I grew attracted towards handling money.

## Links
  While researching about the topic I learned quite a lot about business. This is a link to an [intro to buisness](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/business.asp#:~:text=Although%20the%20aim%20of%20most,profits%2C%20focus%20on%20charitable%20goals.)     . I used another site to get a brief understanding of [the technologly that is used in buisness](https://flexa.cloud/en/8-technologies-most-used-by-companies/). While I was trying to think of an issue relating to business, I looked up "myths about business", leading to an article ["10 business myths reconsidered"](https://www.workspace.co.uk/content-hub/entrepreneurs/10-business-myths-reconsidered). Though I did not use any of these myths, it was useful to help gain a better understanding of what business truly is.

## Skills


## Engineering Design Process
  I am currently in the first and second stage of the engineering design process(EDP), defining the problem. A problem that I've seen was that people don't really know what goes into making and running a business, and the technology side of it. I know that businesses use technology, but that is as far as my knowledge goes.

## Next Step

As time will progress, I will start doing deeper research on business, so far I've only done light research. Next I will note down my imformation so that i could have content to place inside my project.

## Blog
Below you will find my blog about how I made my project.
