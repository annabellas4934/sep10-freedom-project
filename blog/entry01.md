## Why Did I Choose This Topic?
  As a student of the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/) in [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) I will create a year long project called a Freedom Project. For my project I chose the topic of business. My other options included finance and accounting. No matter what I would have picked, I'll still be studying about money. I specifically picked business due to it having the concepts of the other topics within itself. Now, the reason why I am so invested in the topic is because I'm highly interested in that field. I don't particularly find interest in physical work, having someone's life in my hands, and I'm not the best debater, so I wouldn't go into law, medical, or anything of the sort. With business I can go a multiple of directions. I am also influenced by my social media page and my parents. On social media I often see these small businesses that sell all sorts of products that they personally designed. My mother often likes to try many things that may help me pick a career such as asking me to sell my own t-shirts on amazon. Due to these reasons, I grew attracted towards handling money.

## Links
  While researching about the topic I learned quite a lot about business. This is a link to an [intro to buisness](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/business.asp#:~:text=Although%20the%20aim%20of%20most,profits%2C%20focus%20on%20charitable%20goals.)     . I used another site to get a brief understanding of [the technologly that is used in buisness](https://flexa.cloud/en/8-technologies-most-used-by-companies/). While I was trying to think of an issue relating to business, I looked up "myths about business", leading to an article ["10 business myths reconsidered"](https://www.workspace.co.uk/content-hub/entrepreneurs/10-business-myths-reconsidered). Though I did not use any of these myths, it was useful to help gain a better understanding of what business truly is.

## Engineering Design Process
  I am currently in the first and second stage of the engineering design process(EDP), defining the problem. A problem that I've seen was that people don't really know what goes into making and running a business, and the technology side of it. I know that businesses use technology, but that is as far as my knowledge goes.

## Skills
I learned skills such as...

**Organization** 
When I first started, I was quite lost on how I should get started. So while creating this blog I opened up a google doc, to note down what i wanted to put into the blog without constantly having to change the code in github. This method was extremely useful because google docs has simple features that can resemble the final product in github, allowing me to figure out how I wanted to organize things.

**Googling Information** 
Finding links for this blog demonstrates basic researching skills. When I google something I look up the topic as well as what I specifically want to find. Rather than searching business, I added certain words then looked it up so that I can get something more specific to what I wanted to find such as "myths about business", "what is business", "uses of technology in business", etc. this made researching quick and easy. When googling I also tend to search for the site that the ai overview stated from to get more background knowledge and confirm its reliability. Something that also confirms reliability is the type of site it is. I learned that if they have ads they most likely aren't reliable as it means they are sponsored. I also trust websites like ".gov" over ".com".

**Time Management** 
I was given a week to create this blog, yet I only started to work on it on Thursday. I was occupied by sports and my injury so I procrastinated for four days leading to more stress to be put on my shoulders for the weekends. To make my workload easier, I planned what I'd do each day. Friday I would study on what specifically I needed to include in the blog, saturday fill it with content, sunday finish the content and code it into github, and finally monday i will look it over and see if it satisfies the requirements. Doing this helped me also squeeze in personal time, as when I meet my goal for the day I would have time for my own hobbies. This helped me manage my time so I wouldn't be as stressed on the weekends without forcing myself to do all the work on the very last day.

## Next Step

As time will progress, I will start doing deeper research on business, so far I've only done light research. Next I will note down my imformation so that I could have content to place inside my project.
