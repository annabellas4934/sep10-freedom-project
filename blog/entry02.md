## Researching Business Hardware and Software
For the past month I have been researching what applications and gadgets people in businesses use. Of course when I googled "Business apps", I got the basics, google drive, canva, ect. They also showed other apps, but it wasn't clear what exactly these apps were used for. Same goes for when I looked up "Business gadgets", where I found more obvious stuff such as computers, keyboards, and different types of mice. I was encouraged by the teacher to find something more unique and more unknown to a general audience. 

## Links
To gather my research I didn't decide to use whatever answers google gave me, rather I found sites dedicated to whatever I had googled and used those to gather my information. [Ring Central](https://www.ringcentral.com/us/en/blog/free-business-apps/#:~:text=Google%20Drive,access%20them%20from%20any%20device.) and [Square Up](https://squareup.com/us/en/the-bottom-line/operating-your-business/20-small-business-apps-you-need-to-know) are both business applications that made websites to explain what apps business can use. [Fit small business](https://fitsmallbusiness.com/office-gadgets/), [Monitask](https://www.monitask.com/en/blog/ten-must-have-gadgets-for-business-leaders-and-project-managers), and  [Desktime](https://desktime.com/blog/top-productivity-gadgets-and-products) are sites that listed what people can buy to better benefit their business.

### What I found:
Software:
For software I found some apps that helped with communication, file storage, and payments. An app that came as sort of a shock was Slack, it is something we use in class to get support from our peers, and I did not expect for people in business to also use it. There are also plenty of apps for storing files other than google drive like evernote, and these are not exclusively used for business but can be used in other fields as well.

Hardware:
Other than the obvious office supplies, there were a bunch of creative technologies that had a spin to the generic technology. They took notebooks, printing, scanning, and computers to another level. For notebooks I found that you could buy specific notebooks where what you write into them can be transported into an app that stores the exact information as a digital copy. Personally, I much prefer writing on a physical medium rather than typing something online. It is also more efficient for travel as it can be easily accessible compared to a laptop. There are also portable scanners and printers. Of course they can't replace standard printers, but they come in handy for travel and printing something quick. As for the scanners, they use AI technology to skim through documents and provide you with notes based on what they collected.
