## Researching Business Hardware and Software
For the past month I have been researching what applications and gadgets people in businesses use. Of course when I googled "Business apps", I got the basics, google drive, canva, ect. They also showed other apps, but it wasn't clear what exactly these apps were used for. Same goes for when I looked up "Business gadgets", where I found more obvious stuff such as computers, keyboards, and different types of mice. I was encouraged by the teacher to find something more unique and more unknown to a general audience.

To gather my research I didn't decide to use whatever answers google gave me, rather I found sites dedicated to whatever I had googled and used those to gather my information. [Ring Central](https://www.ringcentral.com/us/en/blog/free-business-apps/#:~:text=Google%20Drive,access%20them%20from%20any%20device.) and [Square Up](https://squareup.com/us/en/the-bottom-line/operating-your-business/20-small-business-apps-you-need-to-know) are both business applications that made websites to explain what apps business can use. [Fit small business](https://fitsmallbusiness.com/office-gadgets/), [Monitask](https://www.monitask.com/en/blog/ten-must-have-gadgets-for-business-leaders-and-project-managers), [Desktime](https://desktime.com/blog/top-productivity-gadgets-and-products) are sites that listed what people can buy to better benefit their business.
